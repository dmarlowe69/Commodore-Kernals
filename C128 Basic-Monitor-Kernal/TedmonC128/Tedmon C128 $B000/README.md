# TedmonC128
 
A complete disassembly of Commodore 128 built-in machine language monitor (TEDMON).
Completely relabeled so possible to compile and relocate into whatever address in
C128 memory. Quite easy to modify for another 65xx-based Commodore machine with
small changes, ie. PRIMM-routine ($FA17-$FA3F) should be copied from C128 kernal and all
memory banking related options should be removed.
