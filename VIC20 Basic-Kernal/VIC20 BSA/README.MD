This is a build of the VIC20 BASIC and KERNAL.

In some caes the source code comes from my own disassembly-
reassembly of the ROMs. Other versions are versions I found on the web.
I have tried to reference the source of these files when I can. The goal
was to have code that I could build with 64tass or on the target platform
using native tool sets. Some of the code is also build using Dilbert BSA
